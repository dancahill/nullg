<H2>Calendar Views</H2>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The calendar has two modes in which it can be viewed.  These are the
"Day View" and the "Month View".
</P>
<HR><H3>Day View</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The first mode, the "Day View", displays a complete listing of the selected
day's events which the current user has permission to view.  This includes
any calendar events which are marked public as well as events assigned to the
current user.  Events that are both assigned to the user and set private will
say <I>Private</I> beside them.  All other listed events are publicly viewable.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To add a new event, click on the time field beside an empty slot.  This will
bring up a form for adding a new event.  To view an existing event, click on
the time field beside that event's name.  For more information on adding,
editing and viewing events, see <A HREF=ch03-02.html>Viewing and Editing
Events</A>.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Day View also has a mini calendar view which can be used to easily choose
which day you want to view.  To change the current day, simply click on the
day you want to view.  If you want to change the month and/or the year of the
mini calendar, you can do so by selecting the desired year and month with the
form directly above the mini calendar.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One other feature of the Day View is that it offers access to the Task List
function.  Tasks are quite similar to events, however tasks are generally not
date-dependant.  As with the calendar, only public tasks, and private tasks
assigned to the user will be visible.  Private tasks will have a <I>P</I>
beside them.  To add a new task, click on (new).  To view, edit or delete a
task, click on the task name.  For more information on adding, editing and
viewing tasks, see <A HREF=ch03-03.html>Viewing and Editing Tasks</A>.
</P>
<HR><H3>Month View</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The second mode, the "Month View", displays a complete listing of the selected
month's events which the current user has permission to view.  This includes
any calendar events which are marked public as well as events assigned to the
current user.  Private events have a <I>P</I> beside them.  All other listed
events are publicly viewable.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Within each cell of the calendar, a listing of the time, name and privacy
setting will be shown for each viewable event for that day.  To view an event,
click on the event name, and you will be taken to the view form for that event.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At the top of the Month View calendar, there is a form which will let you
select the month and year of the month being viewed.  To change to Day View
for any of the dates displayed in the current Month View, simply click on the
date, and you will be taked directly to that day's Day View.
