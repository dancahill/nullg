<H2>Listing Messages</H2>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When listing the messages in your e-mail account's inbox, a maximum of 25
messages will be displayed per page.  If you have more than 25 messages, your
inbox will be presented as a number of pages (depending on the size of your
inbox).  Each listing has six columns; a checkbox, the name of the message
sender, the message subject, the date the message was sent, the size of the
message, and in the sixth column, if there is an attachment, an image of a
paperclip.  At the bottom of each page is a button labeled 'Delete Selected
Messages' which, if clicked, will delete all messages on the current page
which have had their checkbox checked.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is important to note that the view as seen from Sentinel Groupware Webmail
is a direct view of your mailbox on the pop3 server.  Deleting a message here
will delete it directly from the server.  Messages are neither cached nor
stored by Sentinel Groupware.

<HR>
<H2>Reading Messages</H2>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Once you've selected a message for reading, either from the message list or
by using the Previous or Next links, you will be given a complete view
of the message text and attachments (if any).
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At the top of each message is the message header information.  This includes
the sender's name and return e-mail address, the message subject, and the
date the message was sent.  Clicking on the sender's name/e-mail address will
allow you to send a new message to the displayed address without referencing
the currently displayed message.  Below the header information is the message
body, and below that, any attachments will be displayed.  To download an
attachment, right-click on the file name, select 'Save Target As...', and
select the location to save the attached file to.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Above and below each message, a sub-menu will be displayed with the following
choices; Previous, Reply, Forward, Delete, and Next.  Clicking on Previous
will take you to a view of the message located before this one in your inbox.
Clicking on Reply will allow you to reply directly to this message.  Clicking
on Forward will allow you to forward this message.  Clicking on Delete will
delete this message from your inbox.  Clicking on Next will take you to a
view of the message located after this one in your inbox.
