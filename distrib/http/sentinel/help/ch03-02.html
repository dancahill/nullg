<H2>Viewing and Editing Events</H2>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The event viewer and the event editor can both be accessed by several means,
two of which are the calendar Day View and Month View.  Both the viewer and
the editor display the same information, however the editor can be used to
add, edit and delete events.
</P>
<H3>Event Name</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Event Name' is a brief one line descriptive name which should be used to
distinguish this event from others.
</P>
<H3>Assigned By</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

this event (or reassigned it).  This field is automatic.
</P>
<H3>Assign(ed) To</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Assign(ed) To' field indicates who the current owner of the event is.  If
this event is marked private, then only this user will be able to view the
event.  In edit mode, if this field is left blank, then the event will be
assigned to the current user.
</P>
<H3>Date</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Duration' field indicates the approximate length of time (in minutes)
which the event is expected to span.
</P>
<H3>Status</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Status' field indicates the current status of the event.  This can be
set to anything, however marking events with a status of 'In Progress' or
'Completed' may be more helpful.
</P>
<H3>Privacy</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Privacy' field indicates whether this event is publicly viewable by all
users, or if access is restricted to the user to whom the event has been
assigned.
</P>
<H3>Priority</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

will start reminding the event owner.

from the event's start date.
</P>
<H3>Repeat Until</A></H1>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

event which do not fit into any of the other fields.
