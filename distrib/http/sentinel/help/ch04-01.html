<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When you first enter the contacts section, you will be presented with two
nearly identical forms.  One is for searching for contacts, and the other is
for searching for companies.  On the left side of each form is an option box
which will let you either search for a match in all fields, or just a selected
field.  The textbox allows you to specify a string of text to search for.
This can be the id number, a name, or anything else you wish to search for.
Wildcards such as * and ? can be used in searches.  The button on the right is
used to submit the search.  Searches are case insensitive.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If a search returns more than 50 results, then the output will be broken up
into pages, each page having 50 or less results.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you are unfamiliar with wildcards, a quick summary is as follows.  The '*'
character can be substituted in a search string for any number of characters.
The '?' character can be substituted for only one.  For example, a search for
"*" (the default) will return all records.  A search for "*1*" would return
all records that have a 1 anywhere in them.  Searching for "1?" would return
only records which have a matching field two characters long, with the first
one being a 1.

After submitting a contact search, a list of all matches will be returned.
This list will show the contact name, the company name, the contact's work
number, and the contact's e-mail address.  Clicking on the contact name will
bring up a view of the contact.  Clicking on the company name will bring up a
view of the company that contact works for.  Clicking on the e-mail address
will allow you to send an e-mail message to that person (assuming e-mail has
been set up).

<HR><H2>Listing Companies</H2>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After submitting a company search, a list of all matches will be returned.
This list will show the company name, the company's primary phone number, and
the URL of the company's web site.  Clicking on the company name will bring up
a view of the company.  Clicking on the Web Site URL will take you to that
company's web site.
