<HR><H2>Downloading Files</H2>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Downloading files from the file base is as easy as clicking on the file name.
This will automatically download and/or open the file according to your web
browser's settings.  In many cases, it may be better to right-click on the
link, and select 'Save Target As...'.  This will allow you to download and
save the file without opening it.  This may be especially useful, for
instance, if you want to open a Word document in a regular instance instead
of inline within the web browser.

<HR><H2>Uploading Files</H2>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To upload a file, click on the 'Upload File' link below the file listing.
This will open a form in a new window which will allow you to upload the file.
Choose the file on your local system that you want to send to the server, and
then click 'Send'.  This will upload the file to the directory currently
selected in the 'file list' view.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Once you click on 'Send', your web browser will send the file.  This may take
anywhere between a few seconds to several minutes, depending on the speed of
your connection, and the size of the file you are sending.  Once the file
transfer is finished, you will be notified that the file has been received.
At this point, it is safe to close the file transfer window.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
File uploads larger than 32 megabytes will be rejected by the server.  If you
really need to be able to send large files, it is strongly recommended that
you use an ftp server.  The main reason for this is that file transfers with
Sentinel Groupware are not resumable.  With ftp, you can resume broken uploads
if the need arises.
