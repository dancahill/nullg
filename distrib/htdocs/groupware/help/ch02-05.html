<H2>The User Editor</H2>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The user editor can be used to add, modify, or delete user accounts.
All aspects of a NullLogic Groupware user's profile, including login information,
security access levels, e-mail settings, and personal information can be changed
from the user editor.
</P>
<H3>Username</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is the login name which is assigned to the user.  Each user must have a
unique username.
</P>
<H3>Password</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is the user's login password.  Each user should be advised to choose a password
which is both easy to remember, and hard to guess.  Passwords are encrypted before
being stored in the NullLogic Groupware database.  If a user forgets their password,
then the administrator will have to assign a new password to the user.
</P>
<H3>Group</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is the primary group of which this user is a member.
</P>
<H3>Allow Login</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This option provides a means of disabling the user account.
</P>
<H2>Permissions</H2>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Access to records is controlled by a strict system of permissions.  At the
core of this system is the set of permissions assigned to each user.  These
permissions control the maximum level of access granted to the user for each
section.  With the exception of <I>Admin</I> access, permission settings are
best demonstrated by the effects of not having them.  A user who does not have
read permission will not be able to read any records in the relevant section
regardless of record ownership or permissions.  A user who does not have
write permission will not be able to modify, insert or delete any record in
that section regardless of record permissions.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Admin access for a section enables unrestricted access to all records in the
relevant section.  Admin access also guarantees the user will be able to insert
and delete records.
</P>
<H3>Administration</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All administrative functions in NullLogic Groupware require <I>Admin</I> access.
Granting <I>Admin</I> access gives the user full permission to all Administration
functions.  Removing <I>Admin</I> permission, on the other hand, removes access
to Administration functions entirely.
</P>
