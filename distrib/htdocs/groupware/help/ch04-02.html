<H2>Viewing and Editing Events</H2>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The event viewer and the event editor can both be accessed by several means,
one of which is to use any of the calendar views.  Both the viewer and the
editor display the same information, however the editor can be used to add,
edit and delete events.
</P>
<H3>Event Name</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Event Name' is a brief one line descriptive name which should be used to
distinguish this event from others.
</P>
<H3>Assigned By</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Assigned By' field is used to indicate the name of the user who assigned
(or reassigned) this event.  This field is automatic.
</P>
<H3>Assign(ed) To</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Assign(ed) To' field indicates the user this event is assigned to.  In
edit mode, if this field is left blank, then the event will be assigned to the
current user.
</P>
<H3>Event Type</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Event Type' field offers a general classification of events.  Default
event types include; 'All Day Event', 'Anniversary', 'Appointment', 'Meeting',
'Reminder', and 'Service Call'.  Adding and editing event types is possible via
direct manipulation of the database.
</P>
<H3>Contact</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Contact' field indicates the person to whom this event is associated.
</P>
<H3>Priority</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Priority' field indicates what importance has been placed on this event.
</P>
<H3>Reminder</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Reminder' field indicates how long before an event NullLogic Groupware
will start reminding the event owner.
</P>
<H3>Date</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Date' field indicates the day on which the event is to occur.
</P>
<H3>Start Time</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Start Time' field indicated the time at which the event is to start.
</P>
<H3>Duration</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Duration' field indicates the approximate length of time which the event
is expected to span.
</P>
<H3>Availability</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Availability' field indicates whether or not the user should be considered
available during the event.  Events marked 'busy' are not allowed to overlap
with each other, nor are they allowed to be scheduled outside the user's
selected available time.  Events marked 'available' are not considered to be in
conflict with any other events or availability restrictions.
</P>
<H3>Status</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Status' field indicates whether the event is open or closed.
</P>
<H3>Closing Status</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Closing Status' field indicates whether this event was cancelled,
completed, or rescheduled when it was closed.
</P>
<H3>Details</A></H1>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Details' field is used to record any additional information relevant to
the event.
</P>
<H2>Autoschedule</H2>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The autoschedule feature allows the user to automatically find and schedule
the event to the selected user so that if the event is marked 'busy', it will
be scheduled to fall within the user's selected available time, and the event
will not conflict with other events which are also marked 'busy'.
</P>
<H2>Autoassign</H2>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The autoassign feature serves the same purpose as the autoschedule feature,
however it also performs two key functions in addition to that of
autoscheduling.  The autoassign feature is used to find the earliest possible
free time from a selected group of users.  Additionally, if geographic zoning
is in use, the autoassign feature will match contacts and users who are in the
same zone.
