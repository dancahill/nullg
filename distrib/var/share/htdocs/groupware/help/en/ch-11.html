<H3>11.1 - Listing Notes</H3>
<UL>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The notebook is a system which allows easy access to notes attached to other
records in the database.  Notes are filtered by user, as well as by the type of
record to which they are attached.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A listing of notes will display all accessible notes of a given type owned by
the selected user.  This list consists of three columns; the note title, the
reference, or record type to which this note is linked, and the date on which
this note was last modified.  Clicking on the note name will bring up the full
record for the note.  Clicking on the reference, if one exists, will bring up
the record to which the note is attached.

<H3>11.2 - Adding and Editing Notes</H3>
<UL>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Notes can be added through a number of different means.  Probably the most
common method of adding notes to the system is by accessing the record to which
the note will be attached, and attaching a note to the record directly.  Types
of records to which a note can be attached include contacts, events, tasks,
users, and other notes.  Notes can also be added directly from the notebook in
response to other notes, or as independent records with no reference.
</P>
<H3>Note Name</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Note Name' field is used to provide an informative title for the note
which is displayed in lists attached to records, and in the notebook list.
</P>
<H3>Note</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Note' field is used to provide a complete description of the nature and
details of the note.
