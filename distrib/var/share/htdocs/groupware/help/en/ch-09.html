<H3>9.1 - Viewing Forums</H3>
<UL>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When you first enter the forum section, you will be presented with a complete
list of all forums which have been created.  For each forum in the list, some
basic information about each forum will be displayed.  This information
includes the forum number, the forum name, who created the forum, and the time
and date the forum was created.  To select a forum, click on the forum's name,
and you will be taken to a view for that forum.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A forum view will display a box at the top with the same information for this
forum as the list, as well as the text body for the forum.  In addition, there
will be two links; Top and Reply.  Clicking on Top will bring you back to this
view from any other view.  Clicking on Reply will allow you to reply directly
to this forum and create a new thread in the discussion.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This view will also present you with a threaded list of all posted replies in
this forum.  Each post to this forum will have a post name, the poster's name,
and the date on which the post was made.  To view a post, click on the post
name.
</P>
<H3>Viewing Posts</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A post view will display a box at the top which is similar to that of the
forum view.  It will show the post name, the name of the user who posted the
message, the time and date the message was posted, and of course, the body of
the message.  In addition, there will be three links; Top, Previous and Next.
Clicking on Top will bring you back to the main forum view.  Clicking on
Previous will take you to the post view of the previous message in the thread.
Clicking on Next will take you to the post view of the next message in the
thread.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Below the box with the post information, there will be a form which will allow
you to post a reply to the current message.

<H3>9.2 - Adding Forums</H3>
<UL>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Forums can be added at any time by clicking on 'ADD FORUM' at the top of any
page in the forums section.  You will be presented with a form in which the
subject and message body of the new forum is to be entered.  Once you have
filled in the form, you can either add or preview the forum.  To save the
forum, click on 'Save'.  To preview the forum, click 'Preview'.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When previewing a forum, the forum will appear exactly as it would in a regular
forum view.  In addition, the original form for adding the forum will also
reappear, so you can make any changes before saving the forum.
</P>
<H3>Adding Posts</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Posts can only be added as a reply to either a forum or another post.  To
reply to a forum, click on 'Reply' in the forum view.  To reply to another
post, click on the post name in the forum view's threaded listed of replies.
In both cases, you will be presented with a form in which the subject and
message body of the new post is to be entered.  Once you have filled in the
form, you can either add or preview the reply.  To save the post, click on
'Save'.  To preview the post, click 'Preview'.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As with forum replies, when previewing a post, the post will appear exactly as
it would in a regular message view.  In addition, the original form for adding
the message will also reappear, so you can make any changes before saving the
post.
