<H3>14.1 - Queries</H3>
<UL>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Queries interface functionality provides an extremely powerful tool for
viewing and manipulating your NullLogic Groupware database.  As such, it is
very strongly recommended that only administrators be given access to add or
edit queries.  It is also strongly recommended that those users with access
to edit queries should take the time to learn the SQL syntax.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Update, Insert, and Delete SQL commands could corrupt or destroy your database
if they are not used properly.
</P>
<H3>Listing and Running Queries</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The first page you'll see when you enter the Queries section is a complete
list of all SQL queries which have been saved in the database.  To edit a
query, click on 'edit' to the left of the query name.  To run one of the
listed queries, simply click on the query name.
</P>
<H3>Adding Queries</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To add a new query, click on 'ADD QUERY' on the top menu.  You will be given
a form with two fields.  The Query Name is a brief but descriptive label for
the query.  The Query is the actual SQL query text.  For information on SQL
syntax, see <A HREF=ch-14.html#language>The SQL Language</A>.

<H3>14.2 - The SQL Language</H3>
<UL>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The name SQL is an abbreviation for <I>Structured Query Language</I>. The
history of SQL goes back as far as 1974, with its initial development at IBM
Research.  Over the years IBM and also a number of other vendors announced SQL
products such as SQL/DS (IBM), DB2 (IBM), ORACLE (Oracle Corp.), and SYBASE
(Sybase Inc.).
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 1986, SQL became an official ANSI standard.  This original standard version
of SQL is often referred to as <I>SQL/86</I>.  In 1989 the original standard was
extended and this new standard is often referred to as <I>SQL/89</I>.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The ISO and ANSI committees have been working for many years on the definition
of a greatly expanded version of the original standard, referred to as <I>SQL2</I>
or <I>SQL/92</I>. This version became a ratified standard in 1992.  SQL/92 is
the version normally meant when people refer to "the SQL standard".
</P>
<H3>SELECT</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The most often used command in SQL is the SELECT statement, which is used to
retrieve data. A simplified version of the syntax is:
<PRE>
   SELECT [ALL|DISTINCT] {* | <I>expr_1</I>
      [, ... [, <I>expr_k</I> ]]}
   FROM <I>table_name_1</I>
      [, ... [, <I>table_name_n</I>]]
   [WHERE <I>condition</I>] 
   [ORDER BY <I>name_of_attr_i</I> [ASC|DESC]
      [, ... [, <I>name_of_attr_j</I> [ASC|DESC]]]];
</PRE>
<BR>
<P>Here are some examples using a SELECT statement:
<P>To retrieve all tuples from the events table we formulate the following query:
<PRE>
   SELECT * FROM gw_events
</PRE>
and get the table:
<PRE>
    eventid | cdatetime           | mdatetime           | assignedby    | assignedto    | eventname | eventstatus | eventdate           | eventlength | contactid | ispublic | priority | reminder | repeat | repeatuntil         | eventnotes
   ---------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------+---------------+-----------+-------------+---------------------+-------------+-----------+----------+----------+----------+--------+---------------------+---------------
    1       | 2001-03-22 22:13:57 | 2001-04-04 08:54:22 | administrator | administrator | Event 1   | Done        | 2001-08-27 14:30:00 | 0           | 0         | 1        | 2        | 0        | 0      | 2000-01-01 00:00:00 | All went well
    2       | 2001-03-22 22:14:07 | 2001-04-04 08:54:28 | administrator | joe           | Event 2   | Pending     | 2001-08-28 15:00:00 | 0           | 1         | 0        | 2        | 0        | 0      | 2000-01-01 00:00:00 |
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Using "*" in the SELECT statement will deliver all attributes from a table.
Obviously, in most cases, this is probably more data than you need at one time
as well as being rather difficult to read.  To solve this, you can select only
specific attributes that you wish to have displayed.  If you want to retrieve
only the attributes <I>assignedto</I>, <I>eventstatus</I>, <I>eventdate</I>
and <I>eventnotes</I> from the events table, you would use the statement:
<PRE>
   SELECT assignedto, eventstatus, eventdate, eventnotes FROM gw_events
</PRE>
In this case the result is:
<PRE>
    assignedto    | eventstatus | eventdate           | eventnotes
   ---------------+-------------+---------------------+---------------
    administrator | Done        | 2001-08-27 14:30:00 | All went well
    joe           | Pending     | 2001-08-28 15:00:00 |
</PRE>
<P>The WHERE clause can be used to select rows whose fields meet a given
criteria.  For example, the query:
<PRE>
   SELECT assignedto, eventstatus, eventdate, eventnotes FROM gw_events WHERE assignedto = 'joe'
</PRE>
will only return rows for events which are assigned to user 'joe'.
<P>The qualifications in the WHERE clause can also be logically connected
using the keywords OR, AND, and NOT:
<PRE>
   SELECT assignedto, eventstatus, eventdate, eventnotes FROM gw_events WHERE assignedto = 'joe' AND eventstatus <> 'Done'
</PRE>
</P>
<H3>Aggregate Operators</H3>
<P>SQL provides aggregate operators (e.g. AVG, COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX) that take
the name of an attribute as an argument. The value of the aggregate operator
is calculated over all values of the specified attribute (column) of the whole
table.
<P>If we want to know the average cost of all products in the products table we use the
following query:
<PRE>
   SELECT AVG(unitprice) FROM gw_products
</PRE>
</P>
<P>The result is:
<PRE>
    AVG_PRICE
   -----------
      22.50
</PRE>
</P>
<P>If we want to know how many products are stored in table products we use
the statement:
<PRE>
   SELECT COUNT(productid) FROM gw_products
</PRE>
and get:
<PRE>
    COUNT
   -------
      4
</PRE>
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SQL is a very powerful query language which extends far beyond the scope of
this simple introduction.  If you want to learn more about SQL query syntax,
there are several good books on the subject.  In addition, MySQL, PostgreSQL
and ODBC are very well-documented by their authors.
