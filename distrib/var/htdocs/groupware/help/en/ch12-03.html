<H3>Listing Products</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A complete listing of all products in the database can be accessed by clicking
on 'VIEW PRODUCTS' from any page in the order system.  In the left column of
the list will be the product name.  Clicking on the product name will take you
to a view of the product's information.  In the second column of the product
list will be the category of the product.  In the third column will be the
unmodified base unit price of the product.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At the bottom of the products list will be a link 'New Product' which will
allow you to add a new product.
</P>
<H3>Viewing Products</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The product view and edit forms display the exact same information.  Both
forms include the following fields.
</P>
<H3>Product Name</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Product Name' field is the short descriptive name that will be used to
identify this product (or service) in most order views.
</P>
<H3>Category</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Category' field indicates the general class of product or service under
which this item falls.  This field is used as a user guide, and has no effect
on the function of the order system.
</P>
<H3>Discount</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Discount' field indicates whether any discount should be assigned to this
product.  If it is non-zero, future sales of this product will receive the
indicated discount.  Note that the number shown on this form is the decimal
notation of the discount percentage (e.g. 50% will appear as 0.50).
</P>
<H3>Unit Price</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Unit Price' field is the base unit price (before discounts and taxes) of
this product for one unit.
</P>
<H3>Internal Cost</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Internal Cost' field can be used for accounting purposes to calculate
net profit for a sale (e.g. Unit Price - Internal Cost = Profit).  This value
is not used in the processing of a customer invoice.
</P>
<H3>PST (Provincial Sales Tax)</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'PST' field is used to indicate the percentage of the unit price to charge
for tax 1.  As with the 'Discount' field, this field is in decimal notation.
8% tax would be entered as 0.08.
</P>
<H3>GST (Goods and Services Tax)</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'GST' field is used to indicate the percentage of the unit price to charge
for tax 2.  As with the 'Discount' field, this field is in decimal notation.
8% tax would be entered as 0.08.
</P>
<H3>Notes on Taxes</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The default taxes, PST (Provincial Sales Tax) and GST (Goods and Services Tax)
may have the wrong percentages for your region, or may be entirely the wrong
taxes for your country.  The names and default percentages of both taxes can
be changed by modifying the corresponding entries in the 'gw_dbinfo' table.
