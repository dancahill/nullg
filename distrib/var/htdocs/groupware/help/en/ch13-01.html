<H2>Modifying Your Profile</H2>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A number of key options are configurable by editing one's profile.  Most of
these options control the way many functions respond throughout the groupware.
Each field, and its effects throughout the system are described below.
</P>
<H3>Password</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Password' field allows the user who is currently logged on to change their
password.  The new password will come into effect the next time the user logs
on to the system.  Care should be taken, when selecting a new password, to make
sure the new password is both easy to remember, and hard to guess.
</P>
<H3>Calendar Start</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Calendar Start' field allows the user to select the starting time of the
calendar's 'Day View'.  If an event does exist for a day view, but falls before
the selected time, the event will still appear, but will be marked
appropriately.
</P>
<H3>Calendar Length</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Calendar Length' field allows the user to specify how many hours should be
visible in the calendar's 'Day View'.  If an event falls after the selected
number of hours, the event will still appear, but wil be marked appropriately.
</P>
<H3>Current Mail Account</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Current Mail Account' field indicates which e-mail account is currently
selected.  When entering the e-mail section, this is the account that will be
accessed by default, and when sending mail to a contact, this is the account
that the e-mail will be sent from.
</P>
<H3>Default Mail Account</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Default Mail Account' field indicates which method to use when sending
e-mail.  This allows the user to specify whether to use the groupware's
built-in e-mail system, or an external e-mail client such as MS Outlook.
</P>
<H3>Max Results/Page</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Max Results/Page' field allows the user to specify a limit on the maximum
number of results to be returned in any list before the results are broken up
into multiple pages.
</P>
<H3>Menu and Frame Style</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Menu and Frame Style' field allows the user to choose the appearance and
layout of NullLogic Groupware.  Three options exist here.  The first, 'Simple
(Frameless)', allows the groupware to be used with web browsers which do not
support frames.  'Standard', the default, provides a simple side menu, and a
framed view for the groupware to run in.  'Outlook'  is similar to 'Standard'
but uses a more complex menu which emulates the style of the menu in MS
Outlook.
</P>
<H3>Time Zone</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Time Zone' field allows the user to specify which time zone they are in.
All records which are time-dependent, or otherwise contain dates and times are
automatically converted to the user's time zone.  If this field is incorrectly
set, then dates and times will appear inaccurate.
</P>
<H3>Geographic Zone</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Geographic Zone' field allows the user to specify which geographic zone in
which they work.  The primary function of this setting is in the calendar's
autoassign function, where an effort is made to automatically match contacts
with users in the same zone.
</P>
<H3>Availability</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Clicking on the [Edit Availability] link will take you to a grid which represents
one full normal work week, broken up into one hour blocks.  Each block with a
checkmark indicates an hour of available time in the user's normal schedule.
Any time block which is not selected will be automatically marked 'unavailable'
for this user.  If no available time is marked, then events marked busy will
not be assignable to the user.
</P>
