<HR><H2>Listing Orders</H2>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When you first enter the orders section, you will be presented with a form for
searching for orders.  On the left side of the form is an option box which
will allow you either search for a match in all fields, or just a selected
field.  The textbox allows you to specify a string of text to search for.
This can be the order id, a name, or anything else you wish to search for.
Wildcards such as * and ? can be used in searches.  The button on the right is
used to submit the search.  Searches are case insensitive.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If a search returns more than 50 results, then the output will be broken up
into pages, each page having 50 or less results.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you are unfamiliar with wildcards, a quick summary is as follows.  The '*'
character can be substituted in a search string for any number of characters.
The '?' character can be substituted for only one.  For example, a search for
"*" (the default) will return all records.  A search for "*1*" would return
all records that have a 1 anywhere in them.  Searching for "1?" would return
only records which have a matching field two characters long, with the first
one being a 1.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After submitting a search, a list of all matches will be returned.  This list
will show the order id, customer name, order date, amount due and amount
received.  Clicking on the order id number will bring up a view of that order.
Clicking on the customer name will bring up a view of the contact.
</P>
<HR><H2>Viewing Orders</H2>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Order views can be accessed by several means, two of which are from contact
order list, and of course, the order search/list.  Both the viewer and the
editor display the same information, however the editor can be used to add and
edit orders.

</P>
<H3>Order Items</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Order Items' list displays all items or products which have been added
to this order.  Each item entry shows the product name, the quantity, any
discount, the base price of the product, PST, and GST.  Order items can be
added or edited by clicking on 'Add Item' or 'edit' respectively.  Items can
be deleting by clicking on 'edit' and then 'Delete'.
</P>
<HR><H3>Notes on Taxes</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The default taxes, PST (Provincial Sales Tax) and GST (Goods and Services Tax)
may have the wrong percentages for your region, or may be entirely the wrong
taxes for your country.  The names and default percentages of both taxes can
be changed by modifying the corresponding entries in the 'gw_dbinfo' table.
