When adding a new order, you will first be asked for the customer id.  If the
name of the customer does not appear on the list, then you may have to add
this customer as a new contact in the contact section.  Once the contact info
is provided, you may create an order for this customer.  Choose the name of
the customer from the list, and click on save.  A new order will be created.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now that you've created a new order, you can add items to the order.
Click on 'Add Item' to add a new item to the list.  You will be prompted for
the product name, and the quantity.  If the requested product is not on the
list, and you do not have an entry for 'miscellaneous', then you may have to
add the product to the database before this order can be completed.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Adding the new item will bring you back to the order view form.  The new item
you just added will be listed at the bottom of the page.  If you need to change
any details for this item (e.g. to change the quantity or the discount), you
can do so by clicking 'edit' beside the item.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Continue adding items until all requested items are on the order.  Once this
is done, click 'edit' at the top of the order form, and confirm that all fields
are filled in correctly.  Check the order type and payment method to make sure
they are correct, and change the 'Payment Received' field to reflect any payment
which has been made for this invoice.  If there are any notes or comments to
be attached to this order, now would be a good time to add them in the
'Invoice Notes' box.  Click on 'Save' and your order is done.
