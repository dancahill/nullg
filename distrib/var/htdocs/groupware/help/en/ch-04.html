<H2>4 - The Calendar</H2>

<A NAME="list"></A>
<H3>4.1 - Calendar Views</H3>
<UL>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The calendar has four views in which it can be viewed.  These are the "Day
View", "Week View", "Month View" and the "Year View".  Each of these views
is filtered by user.  Each calendar view is also filtered by status.
The status filter allows the user to view all events/tasks for the selected
user, only events/tasks which are open, or only events/tasks which are closed.
</P>
<H3>Day View</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The first mode, the "Day View", displays a listing of the selected day's events
which the current user has permission to view.  Each event and task displayed
here can be viewed simply by clicking on the record's title.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To add a new event, click on the time field beside an empty slot.  This will
bring up a form for adding a new event.  To view an existing event, click on
the time field beside that event's name.  For more information on adding,
editing and viewing events, see <A HREF=ch-04.html#events>Viewing and Editing
Events</A>.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Day View also has a mini calendar view which can be used to easily choose
which day you want to view.  To change the current day, simply click on the
day you want to view.  If you want to change the month and/or the year of the
mini calendar, you can do so by selecting the desired year and month with the
form directly above the mini calendar.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One other feature of the Day View is that it offers access to the Task List
function.  Tasks are quite similar to events, however tasks are generally not
date-dependant.  One notable difference between events and tasks is that tasks
do not need to be assigned to a particular user.  Unassigned tasks will appear
in the task list with an asterisk beside them.  If permissions allow, users can
reassign tasks to themselves.  To add a new task, click on (new).  To view,
edit or delete a task, click on the task name.  For more information on adding,
editing and viewing tasks, see <A HREF=ch-04.html#tasks>Viewing and Editing
Tasks</A>.
</P>
<H3>Week View</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The "Week View" display is similar to the day view, however, instead of
displaying events for a single day, this view displays a compressed list of
events for an entire week.
</P>
<H3>Month View</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The "Month View", displays a listing of the selected month's events which the
current user has permission to view.  Each event and task displayed here can be
viewed simply by clicking on the record's title.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Within each cell of the calendar, a listing of the time and event name will be
shown for each viewable event for that day.  To view an event, click on the
event name, and you will be taken to the view form for that event.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At the top of the Month View calendar, there is a form which will let you
select the month and year of the month being viewed.  To change to Day View
for any of the dates displayed in the current Month View, simply click on the
date, and you will be taked directly to that day's Day View.
</P>
<H3>Year View</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The "Year View", displays a mini-calendar view for each month in the selected
year.  Clicking on a month name will take you to a month view of the same
month.  Clicking on a specific day will take you to a day view of the selected
day.
</P>

<H3>4.2 - Viewing and Editing Events</H3>
<UL>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The event viewer and the event editor can both be accessed by several means,
one of which is to use any of the calendar views.  Both the viewer and the
editor display the same information, however the editor can be used to add,
edit and delete events.
</P>

<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Event Name' is a brief one line descriptive name which should be used to
distinguish this event from others.
</P>

<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Assigned By' field is used to indicate the name of the user who assigned
(or reassigned) this event.  This field is automatic.
</P>
<H3>Assign(ed) To</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

edit mode, if this field is left blank, then the event will be assigned to the
current user.
</P>
<H3>Event Type</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Event Type' field offers a general classification of events.  Default
event types include; 'All Day Event', 'Anniversary', 'Appointment', 'Meeting',
'Reminder', and 'Service Call'.  Adding and editing event types is possible via
direct manipulation of the database.

will start reminding the event owner.

<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

available during the event.  Events marked 'busy' are not allowed to overlap
with each other, nor are they allowed to be scheduled outside the user's
selected available time.  Events marked 'available' are not considered to be in
conflict with any other events or availability restrictions.
</P>

<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

the event.
</P>
<H3>Autoschedule</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The autoschedule feature allows the user to automatically find and schedule
the event to the selected user so that if the event is marked 'busy', it will
be scheduled to fall within the user's selected available time, and the event
will not conflict with other events which are also marked 'busy'.
</P>
<H3>Autoassign</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The autoassign feature serves the same purpose as the autoschedule feature,
however it also performs two key functions in addition to that of
autoscheduling.  The autoassign feature is used to find the earliest possible
free time from a selected group of users.  Additionally, if geographic zoning
is in use, the autoassign feature will match contacts and users who are in the
same zone.
