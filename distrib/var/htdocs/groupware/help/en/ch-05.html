<H3>5.1 - Listing Calls</H3>
<UL>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When you first enter the calls section, you will be presented with a list of
all calls, with the newest calls appearing at the top of the list.  If the
number of accessible calls exceeds the user's maximum list length, then this
list will be broken up into multiple pages.  This list will show the call id,
the call action type, the contact associated with this call (if any), and the
date and time the call occurred.  Clicking on the call id will bring up a view
of that call. Clicking on the contact name will bring up a view of the
associated contact.

<UL>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The call viewer can be accessed from the calls list, and by listing calls
associated with a given contact.  Both the viewer and the editor display the
same information, however the editor can be used to add, edit and delete calls.

The 'Call Name' is a brief one line descriptive name which can be used to
distinguish this call from others.

<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Assigned By' field is used to indicate the name of the user who assigned
(or reassigned) this call.  This field is automatic.

<H3>Assign(ed) To</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Assign(ed) To' field indicates the user this call is assigned to.  In
edit mode, if this field is left blank, then the call will be assigned to the
current user.

manipulation of the database.

call.
