When you first enter the forum section, you will be presented with a complete
list of all forums which have been created.  For each forum in the list, some
basic information about each forum will be displayed.  This information
includes the forum number, the forum name, who created the forum, and the time
and date the forum was created.  To select a forum, click on the forum's name,
and you will be taken to a view for that forum.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A forum view will display a box at the top with the same information for this
forum as the list, as well as the text body for the forum.  In addition, there
will be two links; Top and Reply.  Clicking on Top will bring you back to this
view from any other view.  Clicking on Reply will allow you to reply directly
to this forum and create a new thread in the discussion.

<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This view will also present you with a threaded list of all posted replies in
this forum.  Each post to this forum will have a post name, the poster's name,
and the date on which the post was made.  To view a post, click on the post
name.

A post view will display a box at the top which is similar to that of the
forum view.  It will show the post name, the name of the user who posted the
message, the time and date the message was posted, and of course, the body of
the message.  In addition, there will be three links; Top, Previous and Next.
Clicking on Top will bring you back to the main forum view.  Clicking on
Previous will take you to the post view of the previous message in the thread.
Clicking on Next will take you to the post view of the next message in the
thread.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Below the box with the post information, there will be a form which will allow
you to post a reply to the current message.
