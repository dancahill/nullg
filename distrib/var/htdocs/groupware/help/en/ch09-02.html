<H2>Adding Forums</H2>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Forums can be added at any time by clicking on 'ADD FORUM' at the top of any
page in the forums section.  You will be presented with a form in which the
subject and message body of the new forum is to be entered.  Once you have
filled in the form, you can either add or preview the forum.  To save the
forum, click on 'Save'.  To preview the forum, click 'Preview'.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When previewing a forum, the forum will appear exactly as it would in a regular
forum view.  In addition, the original form for adding the forum will also
reappear, so you can make any changes before saving the forum.

<HR><H2>Adding Posts</H2>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Posts can only be added as a reply to either a forum or another post.  To
reply to a forum, click on 'Reply' in the forum view.  To reply to another
post, click on the post name in the forum view's threaded listed of replies.
In both cases, you will be presented with a form in which the subject and
message body of the new post is to be entered.  Once you have filled in the
form, you can either add or preview the reply.  To save the post, click on
'Save'.  To preview the post, click 'Preview'.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As with forum replies, when previewing a post, the post will appear exactly as
it would in a regular message view.  In addition, the original form for adding
the message will also reappear, so you can make any changes before saving the
post.
