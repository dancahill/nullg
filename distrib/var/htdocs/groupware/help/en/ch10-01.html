The NullLogic Messenger is an 'Instant Messenger' similar to that of the AOL
and MSN services by the same name.  While this service has many features in
common with e-mail, there are also many differences.  The messenger service is
intended for short text messages between users.  When a message is sent to a
user, that person will be notified after a short delay (less than one minute)
that they have a message waiting.  If they are not currently logged in, they
will receive the notification the next time they log in.

To list all of the messages currently in your inbox, click on the 'Messages'
link on the main menu.  This will bring up a small window from which all
messaging functions will be available.  When you first open the messenger
window, the first view you will see is the 'message list' view.  In this view,
you will be given a complete listing of all messages in your inbox.

In the first column, there will be a 'delete' link.  Click on this link if you
wish to delete the message.  The second column will display the username of
the message sender.  The third column will display the subject heading of the
message.  Clicking on the subject heading will take to you a view of that
message.

To read a message in your inbox, click on the subject of the message in the
'message list' view.  This will open a new window, and display the message.
In addition to the message, you will be given two links at the bottom.  The
'Reply' link will open a form you can use to reply to the message.  The
'Delete' link, of course, will delete the current message.
