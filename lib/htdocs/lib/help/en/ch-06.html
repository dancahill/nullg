<H3>6.1 - Listing Contacts</H3>
<UL>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When you first enter the contacts section, you will be presented with a side
menu which allows you to display a paged list of all contacts, or only contacts
whose name begins with a given letter of the alphabet.  The resulting list will
show the contact name, the company name, the contact's work number, and the
contact's e-mail address.  Clicking on the contact name will bring up a view of
the contact.  Clicking on the e-mail address will allow you to send an e-mail
message to that contact.  An additional option box beside the e-mail address
serves to allow e-mail to be sent to multiple recipients, as well as choosing
whether the e-mail is addressed directly to, carbon copied to, or blind carbon
copied to the selected contact.  Clicking on the 'Send E-Mail' link at the
bottom of the list will open your default e-mail client with the selected
addressed supplied in the address fields.
