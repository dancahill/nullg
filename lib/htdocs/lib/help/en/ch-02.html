server should downgrade itself (if run as root).  This setting does nothing on
Windows.
</P>
<H3>HTTP Server Host Address - HTTP.HOSTNAME</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'HTTP Server Host Address' setting is used to specify the server name which
NullLogic GroupServer will bind itself.  This can be the server's fully
qualified domain name, the host name, or the IP address of the server.  By
default, this is set to <I>localhost</I> which will normally only allow requests
originating from the same computer the server is installed on.
</P>
<H3>HTTP Server Port - HTTP.PORT</A></H1>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'HTTP Server Port' setting is used to specify the TCP/IP port on which NullLogic
GroupServer will listen for requests.  The default is 4110.
</P>
<H3>HTTP Server Max Connections - HTTP.MAXCONN</A></H1>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'HTTP Server Max Connections' setting is used to specify the limit on the number
of simultaneous http connections.  If this number is set too low, clients may fail
to connect to the server.  Setting this value too high may result in wasted system
resources.  The default is 20.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Note that this setting only affects the maximum number of http connections, and in
no way limits the number of users who can log on simultaneously.
</P>
<H3>HTTP Server Max Idle Time - HTTP.MAXIDLE</A></H1>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'HTTP Server Max Idle Time' setting controls the amount of idle time (in seconds)

<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This setting is not used when ODBC is chosen as a data source.
</P>
<H3>SQL Server Port - SQL.PORT</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'SQL Server Port' setting is used to specify the TCP/IP port on which the SQL
server is listening for requests.  The default for PostgreSQL is 5432, and the
default for MySQL is 3306.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This setting is not used when ODBC is chosen as a data source.
</P>
<H3>SQL Database Name - SQL.DBNAME</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'SQL Database Name' setting is used to specify the name of the database which

This setting is not used when ODBC is chosen as a data source.
</P>
<H3>SQL Database Password - SQL.PASSWORD</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'SQL Database Password' setting is used to specify the password to use when
connecting to the SQL server.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This setting is not used when ODBC is chosen as a data source.
</P>
<H3>SQL ODBC Data Source - SQL.ODBC_DSN</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'SQL ODBC Data Source' setting is used to specify the Data Source Name (DSN)
to use when connecting to the database through ODBC.  The default setting should
be similar to the following (depending on where NullLogic GroupServer was installed
to):
<PRE>
	DRIVER={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)};DBQ=C:\database\nullg.mdb
</PRE>
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As an example, if you wanted to use MySQL through ODBC, you would create a System
DSN called "MySQL" in the ODBC driver manager and use the following setting to
connect to the database:
<PRE>
	DRIVER=MySQL;DBQ=MySQL;DATABASE=nullg
</PRE>
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This setting is used only when ODBC is chosen as a data source.
</P>

the source distribution of NullLogic GroupServer.
</P>
<H3>External Mail Scan Utility - UTIL.SCANMAIL</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'External Mail Scan Utility' setting allows you to specify a script or
executable program to use to scan e-mail for viruses and/or inappropriate
content.  Configuring and using this facility exceeds the scope of this
document, however a sample shell script <I>scan_mail.sh</I> is included with
the source distribution of NullLogic GroupServer.
</P>

<A NAME="activity"></A>
<H3>2.2 - The Activity Log Viewer</H3>
<UL>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The access log viewer can be used to view the contents of the <I>access.log</I>
file which contains a record of transactions processed by the server.
Normally logged activity includes startup and shutdown of the server, logins
and logouts, and notifications of record modifications.  The detail used when
logging events can be modified in the configuration editor by changing the
'Server Log Level' to the desired level.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Available logging levels include:
<DL>
<DD>Level 0 - Minimal - Only server startups, shutdowns, logins and logouts are logged.</DD>
<DD>Level 1 - Light - Logs level 0 events, and notifications when a record is modified.</DD>
<DD>Level 2 - Moderate - Logs level 1 and lower events, each requested resource, and all SQL UPDATE commands.</DD>
<DD>Level 3 - Heavy - Logs level 2 and lower events, and all SQL SELECT commands.</DD>
<DD>Level 4 - Debug - Logs everything that can be logged.</DD>
</DL>
</P>
<H3>The Error Log Viewer</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The error log viewer can be used to view the contents of the <I>error.log</I>
file which contains a record of errors caused by the SQL server or NullLogic
GroupServer.  Some examples and explanations are given below.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In this example, the client web browser requested a URL which does not translate
into an internal command, and it does not represent a file which can be downloaded
by the client.
</P>
<PRE>
	Apr 01 12:05:57 - 127.0.0.1 - Incorrect function call '/nullg/images/logo.png' by administrator
</PRE>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This, and similar errors usually indicate a problem with the SQL server itself.
In this case, the MySQL server which NullLogic GroupServer is trying to connect to
is not running.  The same error could also be caused if the SQL connection information
in the configuration is wrong.  Other similar errors may be caused by
incorrect SQL query syntax.
</P>
<PRE>
	Apr 01 12:07:46 - MYSQL error: Can't connect to MySQL server on 'localhost' (10061)
</PRE>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This particular error may be quite common during initial installation if ODBC
is chosen as the SQL type, and you have not installed the necessary updates on
your system.  For more information, read <A HREF=ch01-04.html>Troubleshooting</A>.
</P>
<PRE>
	Apr 01 12:09:16 - ODBC Error: [IM002][Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Data source name not found and no default driver specified (0)

<UL>
</UL>

<A NAME="user"></A>
<H3>2.4 - The User Editor</H3>
<UL>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The user editor can be used to add, modify, or delete user accounts.
All aspects of a NullLogic GroupServer user's profile, including login information,
security access levels, e-mail settings, and personal information can be changed
from the user editor.
</P>
<H3>Username</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is the login name which is assigned to the user.  Each user must have a
unique username.
</P>
<H3>Password</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is the user's login password.  Each user should be advised to choose a password
which is both easy to remember, and hard to guess.  Passwords are encrypted before
being stored in the NullLogic GroupServer database.  If a user forgets their password,
then the administrator will have to assign a new password to the user.
</P>
<H3>Group</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is the primary group of which this user is a member.
</P>
<H3>Allow Login</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This option provides a means of disabling the user account.
</P>
<H3>Permissions</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Access to records is controlled by a strict system of permissions.  At the
core of this system is the set of permissions assigned to each user.  These
permissions control the maximum level of access granted to the user for each
section.  With the exception of <I>Admin</I> access, permission settings are
best demonstrated by the effects of not having them.  A user who does not have
read permission will not be able to read any records in the relevant section
regardless of record ownership or permissions.  A user who does not have
write permission will not be able to modify, insert or delete any record in
that section regardless of record permissions.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Admin access for a section enables unrestricted access to all records in the
relevant section.  Admin access also guarantees the user will be able to insert
and delete records.
</P>
<H3>Administration</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All administrative functions in NullLogic GroupServer require <I>Admin</I> access.
Granting <I>Admin</I> access gives the user full permission to all Administration
functions.  Removing <I>Admin</I> permission, on the other hand, removes access
to Administration functions entirely.
</P>

<H3>2.5 - The User Group Editor</H3>
<UL>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The group editor can be used to add, modify, or delete user groups.  Groups
can best be defined as logical subcategories of users.  The primary use of
user groups can be seen in ownership of records such as contacts or events.
In this case, a user may choose to grant a higher priveledge to other users
in his/her group, and lesser priveledges to users who are not in the same
group.

automatically marked 'unavailable' for all users in this group.

The zone editor can be used to add, modify, or delete geographical zones.
Zoning is an optional feature which allows all users and contacts to be 
organized into logical subcategories by their geographical location.  The
primary use of zoning is in the autoassignment feature of the calendar system,
where it would be beneficial to automatically assign an event to a user who
works in the same region that the contact is located in.
</P>
<H3>Zone Name</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

zone.
