<H3>12.1 - Listing Orders</H3>
<UL>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When you first enter the orders section, you will be presented with a form for
searching for orders.  On the left side of the form is an option box which
will allow you either search for a match in all fields, or just a selected
field.  The textbox allows you to specify a string of text to search for.
This can be the order id, a name, or anything else you wish to search for.
Wildcards such as * and ? can be used in searches.  The button on the right is
used to submit the search.  Searches are case insensitive.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If a search returns more than 50 results, then the output will be broken up
into pages, each page having 50 or less results.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you are unfamiliar with wildcards, a quick summary is as follows.  The '*'
character can be substituted in a search string for any number of characters.
The '?' character can be substituted for only one.  For example, a search for
"*" (the default) will return all records.  A search for "*1*" would return
all records that have a 1 anywhere in them.  Searching for "1?" would return
only records which have a matching field two characters long, with the first
one being a 1.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After submitting a search, a list of all matches will be returned.  This list
will show the order id, customer name, order date, amount due and amount
received.  Clicking on the order id number will bring up a view of that order.
Clicking on the customer name will bring up a view of the contact.
</P>
<H3>Viewing Orders</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Order views can be accessed by several means, two of which are from contact
order list, and of course, the order search/list.  Both the viewer and the
editor display the same information, however the editor can be used to add and
edit orders.
</P>
<H3>Order Date</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Order Date' field is the date on which the order was originally created.
</P>

<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Customer' field is the name of the customer associated with this order.
When working with the order system, the words 'customer' and 'contact' may be
used interchangeably.  All customers should have an entry in the contact
section.
</P>
<H3>Employee</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Employee' field is used to record the username of the person who originally
created this order.

<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Order Type' field is used to indicate the nature of this order.
Possible entries include 'Sale', 'AR Payment' (Accounts Receivable) and
'Quote'.
</P>
<H3>Payment Method</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Payment Method' field is used to indicate the means of payment used for
this order.  Possible entries include 'Cash', 'Cheque', 'Credit Card', 'Debit
Card' and 'Money Order'.
</P>

</P>

<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Details' field is used to record any additional details for anything
which may not be clear in the invoice and/or any reasons for changing the
order information at a later date.
</P>
<H3>Order Items</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Order Items' list displays all items or products which have been added
to this order.  Each item entry shows the product name, the quantity, any
discount, the base price of the product, PST, and GST.  Order items can be
added or edited by clicking on 'Add Item' or 'edit' respectively.  Items can
be deleting by clicking on 'edit' and then 'Delete'.
</P>
<H3>Notes on Taxes</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The default taxes, PST (Provincial Sales Tax) and GST (Goods and Services Tax)
may have the wrong percentages for your region, or may be entirely the wrong
taxes for your country.  The names and default percentages of both taxes can
be changed by modifying the corresponding entries in the 'gw_dbinfo' table.
</P>

<H3>12.2 - Adding and Editing Orders</H3>
<UL>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When adding a new order, you will first be asked for the customer id.  If the
name of the customer does not appear on the list, then you may have to add
this customer as a new contact in the contact section.  Once the contact info
is provided, you may create an order for this customer.  Choose the name of
the customer from the list, and click on save.  A new order will be created.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now that you've created a new order, you can add items to the order.
Click on 'Add Item' to add a new item to the list.  You will be prompted for
the product name, and the quantity.  If the requested product is not on the
list, and you do not have an entry for 'miscellaneous', then you may have to
add the product to the database before this order can be completed.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Adding the new item will bring you back to the order view form.  The new item
you just added will be listed at the bottom of the page.  If you need to change
any details for this item (e.g. to change the quantity or the discount), you
can do so by clicking 'edit' beside the item.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Continue adding items until all requested items are on the order.  Once this
is done, click 'edit' at the top of the order form, and confirm that all fields
are filled in correctly.  Check the order type and payment method to make sure
they are correct, and change the 'Payment Received' field to reflect any payment
which has been made for this invoice.  If there are any notes or comments to
be attached to this order, now would be a good time to add them in the
'Invoice Notes' box.  Click on 'Save' and your order is done.
</P>

<H3>12.3 - Adding and Editing Products</H3>
<UL>
<H3>Listing Products</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A complete listing of all products in the database can be accessed by clicking
on 'VIEW PRODUCTS' from any page in the order system.  In the left column of
the list will be the product name.  Clicking on the product name will take you
to a view of the product's information.  In the second column of the product
list will be the category of the product.  In the third column will be the
unmodified base unit price of the product.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At the bottom of the products list will be a link 'New Product' which will
allow you to add a new product.
</P>
<H3>Viewing Products</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The product view and edit forms display the exact same information.  Both
forms include the following fields.
</P>
<H3>Product Name</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Product Name' field is the short descriptive name that will be used to
identify this product (or service) in most order views.
</P>
<H3>Category</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Category' field indicates the general class of product or service under
which this item falls.  This field is used as a user guide, and has no effect
on the function of the order system.
</P>
<H3>Discount</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Discount' field indicates whether any discount should be assigned to this
product.  If it is non-zero, future sales of this product will receive the
indicated discount.  Note that the number shown on this form is the decimal
notation of the discount percentage (e.g. 50% will appear as 0.50).
</P>
<H3>Unit Price</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Unit Price' field is the base unit price (before discounts and taxes) of
this product for one unit.
</P>
<H3>Internal Cost</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Internal Cost' field can be used for accounting purposes to calculate
net profit for a sale (e.g. Unit Price - Internal Cost = Profit).  This value
is not used in the processing of a customer invoice.
</P>
<H3>PST (Provincial Sales Tax)</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'PST' field is used to indicate the percentage of the unit price to charge
for tax 1.  As with the 'Discount' field, this field is in decimal notation.
8% tax would be entered as 0.08.
</P>
<H3>GST (Goods and Services Tax)</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'GST' field is used to indicate the percentage of the unit price to charge
for tax 2.  As with the 'Discount' field, this field is in decimal notation.
8% tax would be entered as 0.08.
</P>
<H3>Notes on Taxes</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The default taxes, PST (Provincial Sales Tax) and GST (Goods and Services Tax)
may have the wrong percentages for your region, or may be entirely the wrong
taxes for your country.  The names and default percentages of both taxes can
be changed by modifying the corresponding entries in the 'gw_dbinfo' table.
