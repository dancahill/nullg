<H3>7.1 - Configuring E-Mail</H3>
<UL>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you have not already done so, you will need to configure your e-mail
settings before using the e-mail system.  To add or edit e-mail profiles, click
on 'profile' on the top menu, and either click on the mail account name, or
click on 'Add Mail Account'.  You will be presented with a form with options as
follows:
</P>
<H3>Account Name</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Account Name' field is an informational label used to distinguish this
e-mail account from others the user may have configured.
</P>
<H3>Real Name</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Real Name' field is used to provide a recipient-friendly name.  This is
usually the sender's real name, but may be substituted with another informative
label, such as a division name.
</P>
<H3>Organization</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Organization' field is used to fill the 'organization' field in e-mail
headers.  This is usually the name of the user's company.
</P>
<H3>E-Mail Address</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'E-Mail Address' field is used to supply a reply-to address when sending
e-mail, and indicated to the recipient that any responses should be sent to
this address.
</P>
<H3>Host Type</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Host Type' field specifies the type of mail server to connect to.  Options
include POP3 and IMAP.  Unless instructed otherwise, POP3 is usually the
correct choice.
</P>
<H3>POP3/IMAP Host</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'POP3/IMAP Host' field specifies the host name of the incoming mail server.
</P>
<H3>POP3/IMAP Port</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'POP3/IMAP Port' field specifies the port to connect to on the incoming
mail server.  For POP3, this will usually be 110, and IMAP is usually 143.
Unless instructed otherwise, these port numbers should not be altered.
</P>
<H3>SMTP Host</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'SMTP Host' field specifies the host name of the outgoing mail server.
</P>
<H3>SMTP Port</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'SMTP Port' field specifies the port to connect to on the outgoing mail
server.  This will usually be 25.  Unless instructed otherwise, this port
number should not be altered.
</P>
<H3>Username</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is the login name which you use to connect to your pop3 server.
</P>
<H3>Password</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is the password which you use to connect to your pop3 server.
</P>
<H3>Notify</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If set to 'yes', this e-mail account will be checked at regular intervals
(normally every 1 minute), and the user will be notified when new e-mail is
received.
</P>
<H3>Signature</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 'Signature' field allows the user to attach a signature to the bottom of
e-mail messages sent with this account.
</P>
<H3>Using E-Mail</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Once your e-mail settings are configured, getting started with the web e-mail
interface should be as easy as clicking on the 'E-MAIL' link on the main
menu.
</P>

<H3>7.2 - Listing Messages</H3>
<UL>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When entering the e-mail section, you will be presented with a split frame, and
the top half of the page will list any messages in your inbox.  This listing
has six columns; a checkbox, the name of the message sender, the message
subject, the date the message was sent, the size of the message, and in the
sixth column, if there is an attachment, an image of a paperclip.  At the
bottom of each page is a button labeled 'Delete Selected' which, if clicked,
will delete all messages on the current page which have had their checkbox
checked.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is important to note that the view as seen from NullLogic GroupServer Webmail
is a direct view of your mailbox on the pop3 server.  Deleting a message here
will delete it directly from the server.  Messages are not stored by NullLogic
GroupServer.
</P>
<H3>Reading Messages</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Once you've selected a message for reading, either from the message list or
by using the Previous or Next links, you will be given a complete view
of the message text and attachments (if any).
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At the top of each message is the message header information.  This includes
the sender's name and return e-mail address, the message subject, and the
date the message was sent.  Clicking on the sender's name/e-mail address will
allow you to send a new message to the displayed address without referencing
the currently displayed message.  Below the header information is the message
body, and below that, any attachments will be displayed.  To download an
attachment, right-click on the file name, select 'Save Target As...', and
select the location to save the attached file to.
</P>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Above and below each message, a sub-menu will be displayed with the following
choices; Previous, Reply, Forward, Delete, and Next.  Clicking on Previous
will take you to a view of the message located before this one in your inbox.
Clicking on Reply will allow you to reply directly to this message.  Clicking
on Forward will allow you to forward this message.  Clicking on Delete will
delete this message from your inbox.  Clicking on Next will take you to a
view of the message located after this one in your inbox.
</P>

<H3>7.3 - Sending and Replying to Messages</H3>
<UL>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Whether you're sending a new message, or replying to or forwarding an existing
one, the same form is used in all instances.  In the case of replying to or
forwarding a message, many of the provided fields will already be filled with
the required information.
</P>
<H3>To</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This field should contain the proper e-mail address of the intended recipient.
Only one e-mail address should be provided here, and no extra information,
such as the recipient's actual name, should go here.
</P>
<H3>CC</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
CC stands for 'carbon copy'.  You can specify multiple recipients here in
addition to the address specified in the To field.  E-mail addresses should be
separated by a comma and/or blank spaces, e.g. <I>user1@host1.com, user2@host2.com</I>
</P>
<H3>BCC</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
BCC stands for 'blind carbon copy'.  You can specify multiple recipients here
in addition to the address specified in the To and CC fields.  E-mail
addresses should be separated by a comma and/or blank spaces, e.g.
<I>user1@host1.com, user2@host2.com</I>.  BCC differs from CC in that BCC
recipient addresses are not revealed either to each other, or to addresses in
the To and CC fields.
</P>
<H3>Subject</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This field can contain any text you wish, as it does not affect the delivery
of the message.
</P>
<H3>Message Body</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Message Body box is where you type your message.  If you are replying to,
or forwarding an existing message, then the text from that message will be
displayed in this box.
</P>
<H3>File</H3>
<P CLASS=JUSTIFY>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The File field allows you to attach a file to the message.
</P>
